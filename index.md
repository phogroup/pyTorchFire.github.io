I am a second Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin since January 2021. I obtained his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, after which I worked as a graduate research assistant and teaching assistant at the same university. 

My current interests are in the broad areas of numerical analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. I have developed the model-constrained deep learning approach for solving both challenging forward and inverse problems. I also has been working on solving time-dependent PDEs problems, i.e., Wave equation, Burger’s equation, Navier-Stokes equation, using transformers architecture. I proposed a data-informed active subspace framework for solving inverse problems.
